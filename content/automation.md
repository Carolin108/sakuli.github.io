Over the years systems and processes are growing which leads to potential technology- and media breaks. In such scenarios the automation of processes and daily tasks can get very hard. Sakuli can help to automate tasks between various system boundaries. Download a report from a browser based reporting tool app and upload it to shared folder? No problem. Sakuli closes the gap between browser automation and desktop automation.

## Example Usecases

- Lack of import / export APIs
- Data migration projects
- Automation of third-party tools
- Prototyping of process automation

### Datamigration

When it comes to the migration from a legacy system to a newer system, manual data migration could be the only possible solution to extract data from the legacy system and put it into a intermediate format (for further processing) or insert it into target system directly. So this process is in the best case 'semi'-automated which is error prone, expensive and not repeatable. With Sakuli you can automate all steps in this process.

### Expose APIs from Legacy Systems

You have systems wich lack of APIs but must be integrated into an automated process or workflow? It's possible to expose APIs which triggers Sakuli automated interactions with your system and delivers and/or retrivies data in various formats.

### Create bulk operations

Sometimes it is required to insert a lot of data or executing a lot of operations on the UI of your system. Unfortunally most systems don't offer any way to automate these bulk operations. With Sakuli you can automate any manual interaction with the system and create automated bulk-operations.
