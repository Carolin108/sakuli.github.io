## End-2-End Application Testing and Monitoring â€“ a Perfect Combination

Combining End-2-End Tests with Monitoring solutions proves to be optimal. Because effective quality assurance looks over and beyond any given server: Automated end-2-end tests ensure that your web or rich client ecosystem keeps its promise. Ultimately though, the users will judge the quality of your systems.

## Monitor critical Workflows

Imagine testing your critical processes and workflows by simulating a real user and sending the execution times, warnings and error messages (including screenshots of the system under test) to the monitoring system of your choice. Before the first customer complains about performance, you will be notified automatically and you can investigate to minimize affects on your revenue stream.
