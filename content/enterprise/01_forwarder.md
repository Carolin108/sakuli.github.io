## End-2-End Testing & End-2-End Monitoring â€“ a Perfect Combination

Combining End-2-End Testing with End-2-End Monitoring proves to be optimal. Because effective quality assurance looks over and beyond any given server: Automated end-2-end tests ensure that your web or rich client application keeps its promise. Ultimately though, the users will judge the quality of your systems.

## Test and monitor critical Workflows

Imagine testing your critical processes and workflows (like the checkout process of your webshop that affects your conversion rate) by simulating a real user and sending the execution times, warnings and error messages to the monitoring system of your choice. Before the first customer complains about performance, you will be notified automatically and you can investigate to minimize affects on your revenue stream.
