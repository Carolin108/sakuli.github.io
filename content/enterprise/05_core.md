## UI testautomation with every application

Sakuli combines web testing with testing on native applications. That's all you need to perfectly simulate a real world user. Design your tests, let them run automatically and save a ton of time by reducing your manual tests dramatically.

## Build sustainable tests

Sakuli uses state of the art web-testing technologies like Selenium, wraps a lot of standard functionality and use-cases into user-friendly packages and therefore solves most of the pain points test designers encountered in the past. With intelligent pattern and image matching, you won´t need to worry about every pixel - It was never easier to write sustainable user interface tests.

## Integration of UI tests into CI/CD pipelines

By integrating your Sakuli UI tests into continious integration systems, you will speed up your software development cycles and increase the quality of your delivered software. Sakuli supports a varity of CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Drone IO, Travis-CI and many more.
