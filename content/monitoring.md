Beside the correct behaviour of your system you might also be interested in the actual performance of user interactions with the system. Identifying possible performance bottlenecks - before your users will - is a critical task for operators and administrators. Sakuli makes it possible to integrate such a __real world__ performance analysis in an automated way. For this reason Sakuli provides a generic forwarder interface which gets the latest results of a testrun. The result is a detailed object which contain information about every step in your E2E-scenario including execution time and error describtions which can be send to virtually any endpoint.

Our [enterprise plans](/enterprise) including a set of implementations for various monitoring endpoints.
