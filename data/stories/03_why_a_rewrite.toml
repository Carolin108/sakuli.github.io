Title="Why we rewrote everything"


Content="""
Sakuli was originally created as a proof of concept to show a combination of Sahi and Sikuli UI testing in a monitoring context. From this successful starting point, Sakuli grew and developed more and more into an open source product. But as time passed with new web-technologies emerging and browsers getting more restrictive, some of the fundamental technologies of Sakuli grew old as well. Especially the web evolved a lot faster than the open source version of Sakulis underlaying web automation framework with its proxy mechanism and security policy issues. So we had to decide to try and build a workaround for every shortcoming of the architecture or to build something new and future proof, with the best downwards compatibility we can achieve.

We decided itÂ´s time for something new... Since the language for tests-cases has always been javascript (executed in the JVM-based Nashorn - which is going to be deprecated), Node.js was the technology to go forward with. Sakuli 2 now focuses on an open platform-like architecture to provide a future ready infrastructure which can grow with the coming developments of web standards.
