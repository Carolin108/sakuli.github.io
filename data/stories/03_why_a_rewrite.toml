Title="Why we rewrote everything"


Content="""
Sakuli was originaly created as a poc to show a combination of Sahi and Sikuli in monitoring context. From this successful startpoint Sakuli grows and develops more and more into an open source product. But as time passes by some of the fundamental technologies of Sakuli also getting up in years. Unfortunaly especially the web evolved a lot faster than the open source version of Sakulis underlaying web automation framework. So we had to decide if we try build workaround every shortcoming of this technology (which was also deeply integrated in the framework) or to build something new with the best downwards compability we can achieve?

We decide to build something new. Since the language for testscases was javascript (executed in the JVM-Based Nashorn - which is going to be deprecated) we decide to build the new Sakuli on Node.js. The new version focuses on an open "platform-like" architecture to provide a future ready infrastruture which can grow which the web.
