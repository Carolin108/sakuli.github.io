      <description>End-2-End Application Testing and Monitoring – a Perfect Combination Combining End-2-End Tests with Monitoring solutions proves to be optimal. Because effective quality assurance looks over and beyond any given server: Automated end-2-end tests ensure that your web or rich client ecosystem keeps its promise. Ultimately though, the users will judge the quality of your systems.
Monitor critical Workflows Imagine testing your critical processes and workflows by simulating a real user and sending the execution times, warnings and error messages (including screenshots of the system under test) to the monitoring system of your choice.</description>

      <description>Sakuli Container in a nutshell Our pre-configured Docker container will run Sakuli in an isolated environment which ensures having the same setup and equal conditions for every test-run. You don´t need an unlocked display for native UI interaction with the headless VNC image which is configured in every container. You can watch your test execution live in a browser or a VNC client any time for debugging purposes. Scale your tests horizontally by instanciating as many container as you need.</description>

      <description>UI testautomation with every application Sakuli combines web testing with testing on native applications. That&amp;rsquo;s all you need to perfectly simulate a real world user. Design your tests, let them run automatically and save a ton of time by reducing your manual tests dramatically.
Build sustainable tests Sakuli uses state of the art web-testing technologies like Selenium, wraps a lot of standard functionality and use-cases into user-friendly packages and therefore solves most of the pain points test designers encountered in the past.</description>
